# pg-migration-promise
A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package to help with database migrations -- that is, changes to your
database over time.

It has a Promises based interface and development focused on performance and quality.

The high level idea is to bring your projects' database up to the latest version
in an automatic, consistent manor across many environments (development,
staging and **production**).

## Status
This project is ready for consumption. There are two options to include it in your project.
Please know that this is still under development and it's best if you frequently check
npm for updates

### NPM (preferred)
The [current official release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-migration-promise)
is available in NPM. You can install it with `npm install --save pg-migration-promise`.

#### npm's git integration.
More information here: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#github-urls

## Examples
A basic example is provided below. This product is intended to aid keeping several
developers database instances up to date no matter which version is pulled from
source control. Do note, however, that this product doesn't
support going backwards -- only forwards.

## API Documentation
The full API Documentation can be found at [https://frankv01.github.io/pg-migration/](https://frankv01.github.io/pg-migration/)

A quick summary is follows.

### Migration Definition File
The migration object is a JSON element that contains your SQL to create and modify the
definition of the database.  Basic structure is this:

```json
{
  "1.0.0": {
    "tables": ["CREATE TABLE ..."],
    "data": ["INSERT ..."],
    "indexes": []
  },
  "1.0.1": {
    "tables": ["DROP TABLE ..."],
    "data": ["UPDATE"],
    "indexes": []
  }
}
```

With node, you can define a `.json` file and `require` it to a variable or directly
in the object's construction. The migration definition file can also be `.js` which
allows you to define logic in your migrations. The only requirement is that the json
structure is adhered to.

### App Initialization
After the migration object is setup, preferably in a different module, you execute
code such as the following in a bootstrap or start up module.  Where, exactly, is up
to you as long as it's prior to database access by your application.

pg-migration returns a [promise](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html) so you can perform steps after with `then` or handle
errors which can result from bad SQL or, lets face it, a package bug.

```javascript
const pg_migration = require('pg-migration-promise');
const d = pg_migration({
  connection: 'postgres://john:123@localhost:5432/products', //or an object
  migrations: require('migrations.json') //or a .js file
}); //returns a promise
d.catch(function(er) {
  console.log('pg-migration: Error occurred during pg-migration', er);
});
```

## Contributions
All contributions are welcomed. First time contributes are especially
encouraged as this is a new, relatively simple project with straight
forward requirements. If you want to break into Node JS, this is a good
project.

I am open to suggestions as well; Node is not my "day time forte" but
has quickly become a technology of interest. That said, I'm trying to
take queues from [Nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch)
and [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) and am -- at a
high level -- following those ideas amongst my own.

### Development Setup
The following are the instructions to set this project up on your workstations
for hacking/exploration or for contributions. The intention is to get the
dependencies installed so that you can run the unit tests.
**Unit tests are good!**

#### Dependencies

There are few dependencies that you must manually install.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Please install these via your method of choice. My suggestions follow
- Node
  - Windows: Use installer from the web site
  - Mac OS X: Use the installer or the Linux method
  - Linux: Suggestion is to install from your distributions package manager.
- Postgres
  - Windows: Installer
  - Mac OS X: [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
  - Linux: Your distributions' Package manager

#### Get the source

First, clone the project with your tool of choice. I can't cover all tools
so I'll provide instructions with the git cli.

```
cd ~/github #or where you keep you github/git repos
git clone https://github.com/FrankV01/pg-migration.git
cd pg-migration
npm install
```

Assuming the above commands all execute successfully, the following should pass
100%; Run the following:

```npm
npm test
```

And you should get results similar to the following. The these results were
trimmed:

```
[...]
index
    ✓ no arguments throws exception
    ✓ missing migration argument
    ✓ missing connection argument
    ✓ calls dbMigrate with options; returns a promise


  17 passing (2s)
  ```
